Display a Twitter account latest tweets via a Gutenberg editor block.
 
== Description ==
## Philosophy
This is a simple plugin that will not load a sh*t-load of CSS. Instead, the bare minimum stylings are done for the custom theme so that anyone can customize it with their site design.
It is very developer friendly and offers a couple of smart filters and actions to modify default logic (see `HOOKS.md` file).
You can override the custom default theme template to display a tweet by copying the `/templates/single_tweet.php` file and pasting it in your theme `/templates/lastweets-single_tweet.php` folder. 
This file will be used to display a tweet; customize it the way you want.
